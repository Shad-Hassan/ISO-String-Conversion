<h2 align="center">Whenever you try to get a dateObject from javaScript and you are stuck with this eerie string that looks very omnious! Fear Not , your Boi Shad gotchu , use these functions convert the dreaded ISO string to date and time in mere seconds (ok i actually left out the second part , but you can figure it out tbh) ðŸ‘‹</h2>
</div>

## Usage

- Type node IsoStringDateTime.js to run this code inside your VS code Terminal , to check the functions
- the constant "exampleIsoTimeString" is simply a static ISO String , make sure you change the parameter inside the functions too , when you are working dynamic or a static ISO string in your project
- I used two separate functions for date and time , you can merge them too - I personally felt it too much of an hassle
